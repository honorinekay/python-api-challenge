## Weather analysis of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator
Created plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and Latitude. Computed Linear Regression for each relationship.

Used weather data skills to plan a perfect vacation
Created a map that diplays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. Narrowed down the city_data_df DataFrame to find the ideal weather condition. Created a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country,coordinates, and humidity.
